# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Chester, and I make stuffs work

I work at [Audix](https://audix.io), a SaaS platform that focuses on solving companies' need for audit managments.

In my free time, I just lift heavy metal plates of the ground, go around with a camera and drink coffee.

Some of the things I have worked on:

- [Say Khan](https://saykhan.app): A SaaS startup that focuses on solving medical practitioners' bookkeeping, and paperwork process.
- [getmytypes](https://github.com/halchester/getmytypes): A cli tool to install all your @types/<any> files into your devDependencies.
- [csqa](https://github.com/halchester/csqa): A stackoverflow like platform for devs.
